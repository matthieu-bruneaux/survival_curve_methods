# An introduction to survival curve analysis for microbiologists.

## Aims

-   Provide an overview for using survival curves to analyse time-to-death data in commonly-used virulence model data.
-   Give guidance on things to consider when planning experiments in terms of thinking about levels of replication and how they change your survival curve analysis.
-   Demonstrate how survival curves can be fit using a variety of methods.

## Contact

Any questions of suggestions for the project can be given in the [Issues](https://github.com/padpadpadpad/survival_curve_methods/issues) tab of this repository, or you can email Daniel Padfield at d.padfield\@exeter.ac.uk.

## Further reading

If you want more information on survival analysis beyond the scope of our introductory primers and code walk-throughs, there are other resources available that we have found very useful.
